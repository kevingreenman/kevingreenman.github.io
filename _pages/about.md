I am an undergraduate student studying at Beihang University in Beijing, with a strong interest in the application of machine learning and computational science to environmental science.My current research interest lies in using graph neural network methods, in combination with experimental collaborations, to screen and validate the toxicity of unknown compounds.This motivates my work on the current project,utilizing both conventional machine learning models and neural networks in combination,to predict the acute toxicity of compounds.

In addition to my major courses, I am studying relevant knowledge on C++ programming and front-end web development.But my most familiar programming language is Python, and I have implemented models for my project using Python. I have also studied Statistical learning methods, C programming language, and Machine Learning (also known as "the Watermelon Book").

As someone who is not particularly outgoing, the few sports that I enjoy is table tennis. In terms of music, I have recently developed an interest in Beijing opera, but what makes for a stark contrast is that I also enjoy listening to hip-hop and rock music.
